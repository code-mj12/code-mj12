# Hello, I'm Majid Ahmad, an AI enthusiast turning ideas into reality with code! 🚀

🔭 I'm an AI graduate based in Islamabad, Pakistan 🇵🇰, aspiring to be an ML Engineer with a strong passion for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.

🌱 Deep Learning has particularly captivated me with its transformative potential. From CNNs and LSTMs to Transformers, I have immersed myself in understanding these models and applying them to real-world challenges.

🔍 Currently, I'm focusing on delving deep into the world of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) using tools like Airflow, MLflow, DVC, Jenkins, and more. It's not just about deploying machine learning models; it's about streamlining processes, improving efficiency, and fostering collaboration to revolutionize our interaction with technology.

💡 I don't limit myself to learning alone; I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and insights. That's why I regularly write about various Machine Learning topics on Medium.
