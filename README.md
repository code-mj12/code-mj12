# 👋 Hello, I'm Majid Ahmad Khan!

## 🧠 Data Scientist | 💻 AI/ML Developer 

I am a passionate AI practitioner with a strong focus on **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Computer Vision**. With fluency in **Python** and **C++**, I love to transform data into actionable insights and build intelligent solutions. 

### 🚀 Skills 

I am skilled in using **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Pytorch**, **Scikit-learn**, **Transformers**, **AWS**, **Jupyter**, **Tensorflow**, and more for problem-solving. My web tech expertise involves **Django**, **HTML/CSS**, **Bootstrap**, **NodeJS**, and **Docker**. I have also used **Selenium**, **Beautiful Soup**, **Requests**, and **Scrapy** for web scraping and testing tasks.

### 🔭 Future Interests 

In the future, I am interested in diving deeper into **MLOPS** to bridge the gap between Machine Learning and Operations, aiming to streamline the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of ML models in production.

### 🌐 Contributions 

As an active member of the tech community, I contribute to **Kaggle**, **GitHub**, and **Mozilla Common Voice**.
