# Welcome to Majid Ahmad's GitHub Repository! 🚀

🔭 I'm an AI graduate based in Islamabad, Pakistan 🇵🇰, and my aspiration is to become an ML Engineer. I have a strong passion for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.

🌱  I'm particularly captivated by the transformative potential of Deep Learning. From CNNs and LSTMs to Transformers, I've immersed myself in understanding these models and applying them to real-world challenges.

🔍 t present, my focus is on delving deep into the world of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) with the help of tools like Airflow, MLflow, Jenkins, and others. It's about more than just deploying machine learning models; it's about streamlining the process, improving efficiency, and fostering collaboration to revolutionize how we interact with technology.

💡 My interest isn't confined to just learning. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and insights too. That's why I regularly write about various Machine Learning topics on Medium.
